    "# Agents: Some key concepts\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "In context of Large Language Models (`LLMs`), an agent is an autonomous or semi-autonomous system that can take actions on behalf of the user in a given environment, state, and make decisions or take actions that can accomplish certain tasks. A more detailed explanation of agents would be systems powered by `LLMs`, or `LLMs` themselves that have access to a certain user environment, external sources (such as data) that they can use to accomplish user tasks by efficiently breaking the request into smaller components. An agent can perform these tasks using different components given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "Tools are simple functions (can be python functions) that agents use to interact with `APIs` or external data sources. Tools can be of various kinds but can be divided into two portions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Built-in tools`: Several Agentic frameworks that help you build agents provide tools that are already implemented that you can use through your agent such as:\n",
    "    1. Web search tools to retrieve information from the web (such as `DuckDuckGo`, `Bing Search`, `Wikipedia API`).\n",
    "    1. Database tools such as `SQL Database connector` to execute SQL queries against relational databases.\n",
    "    1. Different frameworks provide a host of different built-in tools. For example, view some built-in tools offered by `LangChain` [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Custom tools`: You can build your own custom tools that perform various actions by interacting with your choice of custom/proprietary `APIs`. View some of these examples below:\n",
    "    1. **Document parsing**: Extract and analyze text from PDF documents, create summaries of long documents, etc. \n",
    "    1. **Task management**: Create and assign tasks in project management systems for your specific use cases and customer stories.\n",
    "    1. **Budget analyzer**: Categorize and analyze spending patterns across your company infrastructure using custom `APIs`.\n",
    "    1. **Code analyzer**: Review code for bugs or improvements using your own fine-tuned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Writing tools are simple as writing functions. You can write tools using different approaches via different frameworks. In this lab, we will go over how we can write tools in `LangGraph`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflows\n",
    "Workflows are how agents can use a predefined sequence of operations that define how an agent can process information and take action. For example, a single agent can have access to multiple tools and be prompted to perform those actions either in a \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `sequential` manner (executing tools one by one), \n",
    "1. `branching`, where the agent dynamically determines which tool to call based on the step it took previously, \n",
    "1. `Cyclic`, where the agent can perform the same set of steps with a human in the loop to review and iterate on the new results or -\n",
    "1. It can be a combination of various workflows and agents interacting all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Persistence/Memory\n",
    "Imagine if you had an agent powering your chatbot serving thousands of users. In that case, it becomes important to retain the memory and the state of the agent with specific user interactions. This is essential for:\n",
    "1. Maintaining conversation context, \n",
    "1. Resuming interrupted operations\n",
    "1. Tracking process across multiple user sessions.\n",
    "Using `LangGraph`, you can retain `short term memory` (which refers to a thread-scoped memory, can be recalled at any time from within a single conversational thread with a user) or `long term memory` (which refers to memory that is shared across conversational threads. It can be recalled at any time and in any thread. Memories are scoped to any custom namespace, not just within a single thread ID.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-in-the-loop (`HITL`)\n",
    "Agents act autonomously and need to be evaluated. This requires iterative testing and a human, who can check the steps that an agent takes and makes sure that the agent is performing and executing the right steps and tools. For this, it is important to have a human-in-the-loop. \n",
    "- This workflow integrates a human input into automated processes, allowing for decisions.\n",
    "- Useful in LLM-based applications to check for accuracy\n",
    "- Examples of these are:\n",
    "    1. **Reviewing tool calls**: Humans can review, edit or approve which tools to call by the agent.\n",
    "    1. **Validating `LLM` outputs**: Humans can review, edit or approve the outputs generated by `LLMs`.\n",
    "    1. **Providing context**: You can have the `agent` or `LLM` return control to the user. This means that the agent will pause and ask the human or user for validation before executing an action. (For example, asking for more information, or clarifying steps to take)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompting\n",
    "Prompting is a technique to control and provide instructions to how an `LLM` can process user inputs and generate responses. In `Agentic` systems, prompts are essential for:\n",
    "1. **Defining the agent's role or capabilities**: Your agent solution might have several agents working together. In that case, having separate instructions and guidance for agents can be provided through prompts.\n",
    "1. **Structuring the agent's thinking process**: Your agent's thinking process is defined by the instructions that you provide in the prompt. This includes if you want your agent to execute certain tools before the others for example.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note**: Prompt engineering is a separate topic and more information on this can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/prompt-engineering/). Prompt templates will be different from model-to-model to get the best performance for your agent use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State management\n",
    "State management in agents refer to tracking and updating the variables that the agent uses based on the conversation history, task progress, available resources and user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent frameworks\n",
    "There are several Agent frameworks that can help us build stateful, persistent agents. These frameworks are either open-source (Such as [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), [Letta](https://www.letta.com/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)) or AWS-offered, such as [Agents on Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/). In this lab, we will be taking an example of `LangGraph` to build your simple agent with memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build a simple agent using `LangGraph`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use `LangGraph` to build a simple agent. `LangGraph` is an open-source low-level orchestration framework for building controllable agents. This library enables agent orchestration, offering customizable architectures such as long-term memory, `HITL`, custom tools, etc. `LangGraph` provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath any workflow or agent. It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides three central benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persistence\n",
    "`LangGraph` has a persistence layer, which offers a number of benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Memory`: LangGraph persists arbitrary aspects of your application's state, supporting memory of conversations and other updates within and across user interactions;\n",
    "1. `Human-in-the-loop`: Because state is `checkpointed`, execution can be interrupted and resumed, allowing for decisions, validation, and corrections via human input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streaming\n",
    "`LangGraph` also provides support for streaming workflow / agent state to the user (or developer) over the course of execution. `LangGraph` supports streaming of both events (such as feedback from a tool call) and tokens from LLM calls embedded in an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging and Deployment\n",
    "`LangGraph` provides an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications via `LangGraph` Platform. This includes Studio, an IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of workflows or agents. This also includes numerous options for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this lab we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a simple agent powered by an `LLM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the `LangGraph` graph state which will have `nodes` as python functions and edges as components maintaining the flow between the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Invoke the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Persist short term and long term memory within the agent."

    "### LangGraph components\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph`, at its core models agent workflows as graphs. These graphs contain nodes, edges and a state. LangGraph revolves around the concept of stateful graph, where each node in the graph represents a step in the application (could be an agent or an action) and the graph maintains a state that is passed around and updated as the computation progresses. You can define the behavior of your agent using these three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `State`: The State schema serves as the input schema for all Nodes and Edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `StateGraph`: This is a shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your graph of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Nodes`: These are python functions that contain the logic to your agents. There are two main nodes:\n",
    "    - `Agent node`: An agent node is responsible for deciding on which actions to take.\n",
    "    - `Tool node`: The tool node will orchestrate calling a respective tool, performing some computation and then returning the output back to the user with the updated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Edges`: These control the flow between nodes. These are python functions that contain logic to determine which `Node` to call next based on the current `state`. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with one another. There are a few concepts to edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Normal Edges**: Go directly from one node to the next.\n",
    "    - **Conditional Edges**: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.\n",
    "    - **Entry Point**: Which node to call first when user input arrives.\n",

    "### Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is key for any agentic conversation which is `Multi-Turn` or `Multi-Agent` collaboration conversation and more so if it spans multiple days. The 3 main aspects of Agents are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tools\n",
    "1. Memory\n",
    "1. Planners\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is a cognitive function that allows people to store, retrieve, and use information to understand their present and future. Consider the frustration of working with a colleague who forgets everything you tell them, requiring constant repetition! As AI agents undertake more complex tasks involving numerous user interactions, equipping them with memory becomes equally crucial for efficiency and user satisfaction. With memory, agents can learn from feedback and adapt to users' preferences. This guide covers two types of memory based on recall scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Short-term memory, or thread-scoped memory, can be recalled at any time from within a single conversational thread with a user. LangGraph manages short-term memory as a part of your agent's state. State is persisted to a database using a checkpointer so the thread can be resumed at any time. Short-term memory updates when the graph is invoked or a step is completed, and the State is read at the start of each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Long-term memory is shared across conversational threads. It can be recalled at any time and in any thread. Memories are scoped to any custom namespace, not just within a single thread ID. LangGraph provides stores to let you save and recall long-term memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example lab, we will be leveraging a `multi-thread`, `multi-session` persistence to chat messages. That way, we will be able to retrieve memory across various sessions and chats across several users. Ideally you would leverage persistence like Redis store to save messages per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can have several Patterns - we can have each Agents with it's own Session memory\n",
    "1. Or we can have the whole Graph have a combined memory in which case each agent will get it's own memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MemorySaver` or the Store have the concept of separating sections of memory by Namespaces or by Thread ID's and those can be leveraged to either 1/ Use the graph level message or memory 2/ Each agent can have it's own memory via space in saver or else having it's own saver like we do in the `ReACT` agent"
